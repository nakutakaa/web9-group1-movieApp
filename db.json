        "One of my all-time favorites.  Kirk Douglas in his action-packed prime simply oozes charisma, while the three-sided romance between he, Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh just begs each viewer to pick his own favorite (“two horns on the head of the same goat”).\nThe musical score perfectly complements the interaction between these far deeper than would be expected characters in a mere action adventure tale.  Wonderful cinematography caps off a film which works magnificently from all angles."

        "a great movie that is ahead of its time, just the thought of how people are amazed by this movie on the year it was released amuses me. People back then were probably shocked and in awe of the concept that back then was pretty much hard to grasp. 20 years later i think the audience will still be amazed just as how it amazed me, even though there have been dozens of films that basically had the same plot and executed a much greater CGI effect."

Being honest I think all of the characters played there roles great and in some parts the CGI was so good along with acting that the first time I watched I literally dreaded the moment.",
